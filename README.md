# Spam filter
This spam filter uses naive Bayes classifier.

Data set was downloaded from http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/.

It is also available on http://dcomp.sor.ufscar.br/talmeida/smsspamcollection/.

To set up the filter you have to :
  1. Download the repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/zrajnis/spam-filter`
  2. Position into the directory and type `npm install`

## Usage:
```
const filter= require('spam-filter/naiveBayes')

const spamMsg = 'call fox tv for money today!'

// Returns boolean
filter.isSpam(spamMsg) //true

//  Returns exact category (good or bad), or 'none' if string can't be categorized
filter.classify(spamMsg) // 'bad'

// Generates javaScript object with 5500 SMS messages categorized
// Object is generated by default, use only if you have trained it and want to reset it to defaults
filter.generate()

// Train the filter,use category 'good' for non-spam and 'bad' for spam
filter.train(spamMsg, 'bad')
```
